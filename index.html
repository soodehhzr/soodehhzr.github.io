                    <p>Greetings! I'm Soodeh, and welcome to my website!</p>
                    <p>I was born in a musical family. My father was a multi-instrumentalist. He was an advanced pianist and a skillful percussionist. I still have books containing the melodies  that he had written. Sadly, my father passed away when I was 3 years old. However, I feel that I have inherited “the muse” from him, since I have been constantly engaged in musical activities since my childhood. In my early years, I took  piano classes and  mastered my playing skills. </p>
                    <p>When I was studying at highschool, I found out that I am so enthusiastic about teaching topics that I was good at. That became more clear when I decided to work with children. That's why I acquired the TTC certificate, so I can teach kids the basics of the english language. Besides that, I have been introducing many children to music by teaching beginner piano lessons. I just absolutely love it while seeing little children take their first steps in music. </p>
                    <p>In my last year of high school, since there are not many decent music schools in Iran, I consulted with my teachers and advisors for considering alternatives, and they recommended me to pursue a management major in the university. I took their advice and enrolled in a Industrial Management bachelor’s program at Ershad University. This program, in addition to the work experience that I acquired afterwards gave me so many insights, amongst them, how to efficiently manage employees, organize a group of people. But yet there was something missing, Music.</p>
                    <p>That was the reason for enrolling in a two-years program for Classical Music Performance at the University of Applied Science. I managed to score more than 80 percent marks, hence I am one of the top ranks among all students. While studying, I also decided to increase the amount of piano students that I had. Receiving positive feedback pushed me even further, to the point where I decided to steer my career towards music even more. Thus, during COVID quarantine period, I also enrolled in an online Pedagogy program at University of Zurich, and managed to finish it with merit and obtain the certification. </p>
                    <p>Apart from all that, I played at multiple piano recital performances, composed a few songs, and accompanied other artists from all over the world in creating music and jamming performances.</p>
